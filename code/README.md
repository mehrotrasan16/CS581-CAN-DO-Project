# Our Code

We've worked on different stages of a machine learning problem in different jupyter notebooks. In this folder you will find scripts and notebooks illustrating our work in:
1. Data Preparation
2. Data Exploration
3. LSTM Experiments
4. TCN Experiments

## Data Preparation

Why are we doing this?
* This dataset is real CAN logs 
* The given format is not right for direct input to models.
* all ml experiments start with cleaning the dataset
* we plan to spend 80% of time understanding the data vs 20% actually modelling and predicting, because of the complexity of the networks and the problem that we're working with.
