CS581 Project outline

Application: Anomaly Detection on the Edge with RNNs, TCNs and Optimized TCNs

Models used: RNNs(LSTMs/LSTM Autoencoders), TCNs, Quantized and Weight Pruned TCNs, (maybe HTMs)

Implementations:
TCNS are being hailed across the board as the successors to RNNs
TCNs are not part of a standard keras/tensorflow API, so I will be working with a reference implementation based on the code provided by the authors of this paper(An Empirical Evaluation of Generic Convolutional and Recurrent Networks
for Sequence Modeling)(reference: https://github.com/locuslab/TCN, https://github.com/philipperemy/keras-tcn#keras-tcn)
LSTMs can be used via keras models, PyOD package's implementation or H2O models(PyOD - Python Outlier Detection Toolkit, H20 - Java based toolkit for data science)

Optimizations:
I will experiment with compression and optimization techniques covered in our assignment 3 - the Temporal Convolutional Networks in the reference code are implemented Conv1D layers,
So almost all our techniques will be applicable.
It will be interesting to apply these optimizations on RNNs and LSTMs. It is something we have not covered in class so I will have to understand the computations performed in these types of networks before implementing the optimizations and seeing how they affect the models.
Some would be:
- Quantization to float16
- Weight sharing
- Weight Pruning 

Datasets:
Kitsune -  Network Intrusion Detection - Mirai Botnet Dataset:
A preprocessed (feature extracted) network capture from an IoT network, where the Mirai malware (botnet) begins infecting other devices and tries to call home to its Command & Control Server after approximately 1 million packets.  
Size ~ 1.27 GB - 764,000 packets. 
116 Columns(extracted statistical features for each packet extracted using the AfterImage feature extractor.)
